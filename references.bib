  abstract = {Firefly species (Lampyridae) vary in the color of their adult bioluminescence. It has been hypothesized that color is selected to enhance detection by conspecifics. One mechanism to improve visibility of the signal is to increase contrast against ambient light. High contrast implies that fireflies active early in the evening will emit yellower luminescence to contrast against ambient light reflected from green vegetation, especially in habitats with high vegetation cover. Another mechanism to improve visibility is to use reflection off the background to enhance the light signal. Reflectance predicts that sedentary females will produce greener light to maximize reflection off the green vegetation on which they signal. To test these predictions, we recorded over 7500 light emission spectra and determined peak emission wavelength for 675 males, representing 24 species, at 57 field sites across the Eastern United States. We found support for both hypotheses: males active early in more vegetated habitats produced yellower flashes in comparison to later-active males with greener flashes. Further, in 2 of the 8 species with female data, female light emissions were significantly greener as compared to males.},

Our theoretical results do not support the experimentally deduced conclusion that the color modulation of the emitted light primarily depends on the size of the compact luciferase protein cavity embedding the excited oxyluciferin molecule. Rather, we find, in agreement with recent experimental observations, that the wavelength of the emitted light depends on the polarity of the microenvironment at the phenol/phenolate terminal of the benzothiazole fragment in oxyluciferin.},

It was shown that active site mutations that resulted in spectral shifts of bioluminescence as a rule caused substantial decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. At the same time, mutations in the conservative regions of the protein amino acid sequence that were in the periphery of the protein globe resulted in red shift of the bioluminescence spectra without affecting catalytic activity. Correlation was observed between the value of spectral shift and polarizability of the introduced amino acid residue: the higher the polarizability, the larger was the red shift of bioluminescence.

  abstract = {Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from substrate firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen. We had previously developed a working model of the luciferase active site based on the X-ray structure of the enzyme without bound substrates. In our model, the side chain guanidinium group of Arg218 appears to be located in close proximity to the substrate's hydroxyl group at the bottom of the luciferin binding pocket. A similar role for Arg337 also has been proposed. We report here the construction, purification, and characterization of mutant luciferases R218A, R218Q, R218K, R337Q, and R337K. Alteration of the Arg218 side chain produced enzymes with 15-20-fold increases in the Km values for luciferin. The contrasting near-normal Km values for luciferin determined with the Arg337 enzymes support our proposal that Arg218 (and not Arg337) is an essential luciferin binding site residue. Bioluminescence emission studies indicated that in the absence of a positively charged group at position 218, red bioluminescence was produced. Based on this result and those of additional fluorescence experiments, we speculate that Arg218 maintains the polarity and rigidity of the emitter binding site necessary for the normal yellow-green emission of P. pyralis luciferase. The findings reported here are interpreted in the context of the firefly luciferase X-ray structures and computational-based models of the active site.},

Two red variants (Q283R and S284G) and one orange mutant (S293P) contained a single substitution. Although the remaining orange variant contained two mutations, L287I mainly contributed to the color change. Emission spectra collected on whole cells at pH 7.0 revealed that while a single peak of {$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 605 nm accounts for red light production by the Q283R and S284G variants, orange light results from the contribution of two peaks of {$\lambda$}max {$\approx$} 560 and 600 nm. All spectra underwent a red-shift when cells were assayed under acidic conditions, whereas a blue-shift was observed at pH 8.0, indicating that the internal pH of Escherichia coli is close to the external pH shortly after imposition of acid or alkaline stress. In addition, changes in assay pH led to bimodal emission spectra, lending support to the idea that bioluminescence color is determined by the relative contribution of yellow\textendash green and red\textendash orange peaks. The set of multicolored luciferase mutants described here may prove useful for a variety of applications including biosensing, pH monitoring, and tissue and animal imaging.},

Here, we report on the quantitative spectra of firefly bioluminescence catalysed by wild-type and four site-directed mutant luciferases. While the mutation caused different emission spectra, the spectra differed only in the intensity of the green component ({$\lambda$}max \textasciitilde{} 560\hspace{0.25em}nm). In contrast, the orange ({$\lambda$}max \textasciitilde{} 610\hspace{0.25em}nm) and red ({$\lambda$}max \textasciitilde{} 650\hspace{0.25em}nm) components present in all the spectra were almost unaffected by the modifications to the luciferases and changes in pH. Our results reveal that the intensity of the green component is the unique factor that is influenced by the luciferase structure and other reaction conditions.},

  abstract = {Firefly luciferases produce yellow-green light under physiological and alkaline conditions, however at acidic pH, higher temperatures or in the presence of heavy metals the color changes to red, a property called pH-sensitivity. Despite many decades of studies, the proton and metal binding sites responsible for pH-sensitivity remain enigmatic. Previously we suggested that the salt bridge E311/R337 keeps a closed conformation of the luciferin phenolate binding site. Here we further investigated the effect of this salt bridge and mutations of the neighbor residues H310 and E/N354, on metal and pH-sensitivity of firefly luciferases emitting distinct bioluminescence colors (Cratomorphus distinctus: 548\,nm; Macrolampis sp2: 569\,nm). The substitutions of H310 and E/N354 modulate metal sensitivity, whereas the carboxylate of E311 may work as the catalytic base essential for green bioluminescence and pH-sensitivity. Modeling studies showed that H310, E311 and E354 side-chains coordinate Zinc, constituting the metal binding site and the pH-sensor. Electrostatic potential and pKa calculations suggest that the external couple H310/E354 is affected by pH, whereas E311/R337 make a stabilized internal pair which retains excited oxyluciferin ejected proton near its phenolate group into a high energy state, promoting yellow-green bioluminescence. Protonation or metal binding weaken these electrostatic gates and their ability to retain the excited oxyluciferin released proton near its phenolate, promoting red light emission.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence is found across the tree of life and has many functions. Yet we understand very little about its timing and origins, particularly as a predator avoidance strategy. Understanding the timing between bioluminescence and predator origins has yet to be examined and can help elucidate the evolution of this ecologically important aposematic signal. Using the most prevalent bioluminescent group, fireflies, where bioluminescence primarily functions as aposematic and sexual signals, the timing for the origins of both potential predators of fireflies and bioluminescence is explored. Divergence time estimations were performed using genomic-scale phylogenetic reconstructions, and multiple fossil calibration points, allowing for a robust estimate for the origin of lampyrid bioluminescence as a terrestrial and as an aerial signal. Our results recover the origins of terrestrial beetle bioluminescence at 141.17 (122.63\textendash 161.17) mya and firefly aerial bioluminescence at 133.18 (117.86\textendash 152.47) mya with a large dataset focused on Lampyridae; and terrestrial bioluminescence as 148.03 (130.12\textendash 166.80) mya, with the age of aerial bioluminescence at 104.97 (99.00\textendash 120.90) mya with a complementary broad Elateroidea dataset. These ages predate the origins of all known extant aerial predators (i.e., bats and birds) and support the much older terrestrial predators (assassin bugs, frogs, ground beetles, lizards, snakes, hunting spiders, and harvestmen) as the most likely drivers of terrestrial bioluminescence in beetles, and sexual signaling likely being the original function in aerial fireflies.},

We reconstruct the phylogeny of the bioluminescent elateroid beetles (i.e. Elateridae, Lampyridae, Phengodidae and Rhagophthalmidae), analysing genomic data of Sinopyrophorus Bi \& Li, and in light of our phylogenetic results, we erect Sinopyrophoridae Bi \& Li, stat.n. as a clicking elaterid-like sister group of the soft-bodied bioluminescent elateroid beetles, that is, Lampyridae, Phengodidae and Rhagophthalmidae. We suggest a single origin of bioluminescence for these four families, designated as the `lampyroid clade', and examine the origins of bioluminescence in the terminal lineages of click beetles (Elateridae). The soft-bodied bioluminescent lineages originated from the fully sclerotized elateroids as a derived clade with clicking Sinopyrophorus and Elateridae as their serial sister groups. This relationship indicates that the bioluminescent soft-bodied elateroids are modified click beetles. We assume that bioluminescence was not present in the most recent common ancestor of Elateridae and the lampyroid clade and it evolved among this group with some delay, at the latest in the mid-Cretaceous period, presumably in eastern Laurasia. The delimitation and internal structure of the elaterid-lampyroid clade provides a phylogenetic framework for further studies on the genomic variation underlying the evolution of bioluminescence.},

The biological role of firefly lanterns in adults is related to sexual communication, but why the eggs and pupae glow remains uncertain. In this study, we isolated the gene Luc2 from L. parvula, and compared its expression profiles and enzymatic characteristics with those of Luc1. A semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that Luc1 was predominantly expressed in larvae, prepupae, pupae and adults, whereas Luc2 was expressed in eggs, prepupae, pupae and adult females. Enzymatic analyses showed that the luminescent color of Luc1 matches the visual sensitivity of L. parvula eyes, whereas that of Luc2 is very different from it. These results suggest that the biological role of Luc2 expressed in immobile stages is not intraspecific communication.},

This assumption is violated for protein-coding sequences, and we consider modeling approaches where codon positions (CPs) are treated as separate categories of sites because within each category the assumption is more reasonable. Such ``codon-position'' models have been shown to explain the evolution of codon data better than homogenous models in previous studies. This paper examines the ways in which codon-position models outperform homogeneous models and characterizes the differences in estimates of model parameters across CPs. Using the PANDIT database of multiple species DNA sequence alignments, we quantify the differences in the evolutionary processes at the 3 CPs in a systematic and comprehensive manner, characterizing previously undescribed features of protein evolution. We relate our findings to the functional constraints imposed by the genetic code, protein function, and the types of mutation that cause synonymous and nonsynonymous codon changes. The results increase our understanding of selective constraints and could be incorporated into phylogenetic analyses or gene-finding techniques in the future. The methods used are extended to an overlapping reading frame data set, and we discover that overlapping reading frames do not necessarily cause more stringent evolutionary constraints.},

Firefly luciferase genes have been isolated from more than 30 species, producing light ranging in color from green to orange-yellow. Here, we reconstructed seven ancestral firefly luciferase genes, characterized the enzymatic properties of the recombinant proteins, and determined the crystal structures of the gene from ancestral Lampyridae. Results showed that the synthetic luciferase for the last common firefly ancestor exhibited green light caused by a spatial constraint on the luciferin molecule in enzyme, while fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activity, an original function of firefly luciferase, was diminished in exchange. All known firefly species are bioluminescent in the larvae, with a common ancestor arising approximately 100 million years ago. Combined, our findings propose that, within the mid-Cretaceous forest, the common ancestor of fireflies evolved green light luciferase via trade-off of the original function, which was likely aposematic warning display against nocturnal predation.},

We had previously developed [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. A., Murtiashaw, M. H., Anderson, S. M., and Zimmer, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15311-15319] a molecular graphics-based working model of the luciferase active site starting with the first X-ray structure [Conti, E., Franks, N. P., and Brick, P. (1996) Structure 4, 287-298] of the enzyme without bound substrates. In our model, the luciferin binding site contains 15 residues that are within 5 \AA{} of the substrate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made changes at all of these residues and report here the characterization of the corresponding expressed and purified proteins. Of the 15 residues studied, 12 had a significantly ({$\geq$}4-fold Km difference) altered binding affinity for luciferin and seven residues, spanning the primary sequence region Arg218-Ala348, had substantially ({$\geq$}30 nm) red-shifted bioluminescence emission maxima when mutated. We report here an interpretation of the roles of the mutated residues in substrate binding and bioluminescence color determination. The results of this study generally substantiate the accuracy of our model and provide the foundation for future experiments designed to alter the substrate specificity of firefly luciferase.},

  abstract = {Under physiological conditions firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from the substrates luciferin, Mg-ATP, and oxygen. In nature, bioluminescence emission by beetle luciferases is observed in colors ranging from green ({$\sim$}530 nm) to red ({$\sim$}635 nm), yet all known luciferases use the same luciferin substrate. In an earlier report [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. M., Murtiashaw, M. H., Anderson, S. M., and Zimmer, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15311-15319], we described the effects of mutations at His245 on luciferase activity. In the context of molecular modeling results, we proposed that His245 is located at the luciferase active site. We noted too that the H245 mutants displayed red-shifted bioluminescent emission spectra. We report here the construction and purification of additional His245 mutants, as well as mutants at residues Lys529 and Thr343, all of which are stringently conserved in the beetle luciferase sequences. Analysis of specific activity and steady-state kinetic constants suggested that these residues are involved in luciferase catalysis and the productive binding of substrates. Bioluminescence emission spectroscopy studies indicated that point mutations at His245 and Thr343 produced luciferases that emitted light over the color range from green to red. The results of mutational and biochemical studies with luciferase reported here have enabled us to propose speculative mechanisms for color determination in firefly bioluminescence. An essential role for Thr343, the participation of His245 and Arg218, and the involvement of bound AMP are indicated.},
